I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', "Rest in peace to Bon Scott" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
